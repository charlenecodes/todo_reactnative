# Todo List on React Native

This is my first completed project on React Native created with React Native and Expo Go
  - The user has the ability to:
    -  add an item to the list
    -  mark a completed task with a strikethrough, which is useful for recurring tasks
    -  remove an item from the list
     
I followed the tutorial from [Made with Matt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kL6nhutjQ8&list=LL&index=1&t=628s) and modified the code based on the styling that I wanted and from the updated React Native documentation, which recommends Pressable instead of the Touchable components.
